# Project Template
## What is this?
This is a simple project template to make starting front-end apps easier for me. Uses webpack to load and compile the sources.

## Includes
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Handlebars
- SASS

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone or download the repo
2. run `npm install` inside the repo dir
3. Change the remote with `git remote seturl origin <newurl>` if cloned
4. Make modifications to the files inside the `src` directory
5. Use `npm run dev` to build a development version
6. Use `npm run server` to run the webpack-dev-server
7. Use `npm run prod` to build a production version
